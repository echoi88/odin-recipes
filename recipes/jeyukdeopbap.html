        <h1>Jeyuk Deopbap</h1>

        <p>Pork dishes in Korean cuisine usually have strong flavors and seasonings like hot pepper paste (gochujang), hot pepper flakes (gochu-garu), and/or garlic, which can make them all a little similar. But this one has a juicy, brothy sauce that softens the vegetables and where the paper-thin pork cooks quickly and mixes nicely. Everything incorporates well in that juicy sauce. I prefer to add an over easy egg with a runny yolk to add more flavor and color, like bibimbap. It's a great combination!</p>
