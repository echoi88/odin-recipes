                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>When a Korean mom chooses the first real meal for her baby, she chooses doenjang-jjigae (or soup made
                        with soybean paste, doenjang-guk) with fluffy white rice. To make it go down easy she mixes the stew
                        with the rice and feeds it to her child. Years later, when the child is grown and living far away,
                        she makes it for them whenever they come home again, because every child has ingrained memories of
                        mom's doenjang-jjigae. It's something they know and love and are always comforted with. Most of you
                        don't have homemade doenjang, so you can use store-bought doenjang with the same recipe. It will
                        still be delicious, I promise!</p>

                            earthenware pot or other heavy pot.</li>
                        <li>Wrap the dried anchovies in cheesecloth (or a dashi bag, a pouch for stock-making sold at a
                            Korean grocery store), and put them into the pot with other ingredients Add water and cover.
